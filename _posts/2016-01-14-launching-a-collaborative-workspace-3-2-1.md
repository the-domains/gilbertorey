A few months ago a couple freelancers started playing around with the idea of a collaborative workspace in Humboldt Park. Before we knew it, the idea snowballed, from 2 freelancers to 5 and Incue was born. So what has brought us to this point? What and Why are we building a collaborative workspace? 

Glad you've asked. :)

# Launching a Collaborative Workspace 3\. 2\. 1\.

****

**The Situation**

We are videographers, designers, and business consultants who run our own independent businesses.  We found ourselves looking for space to house our growing businesses. We looked to do two things:

1. Have a space to bring clients and show that our independent businesses are in it for the long run.
2. Cultivate an environment with creatives to assist and share ideas for growth and inspiration.

****

**The Opportunity**

A co-working space based out of Chicago's Humboldt Park. A space for creatives to ideate and operate their business from. 

****

**The Outcome**

2 months after the first shared thought, we find ourselves moving into the office space that is Incue. 

Incue is an aspiring tech Â­collaborative workspace and entrepreneurial incubator. The shared spacehouses digital creatives in an environment that will soon allow for project collaboration, innovative thinking and the exchange of big ideas.

So what is the future of Incue? Who operates out of our new location? And how can you find out more about what we are working on? Stay tuned as we share with you our progress.
