description: "Kai Stinchcombe's grandmother Ruth got swindled out of $40,000 of her savings through credit card scams. Ruth, a retired schoolteacher who suffered from dementia, was preyed upon by telemarketers and salespeople in the last decade of her life. Stinchcombe inherited the job of calling up her grandmother's banks to try to retrieve some of the funds."
